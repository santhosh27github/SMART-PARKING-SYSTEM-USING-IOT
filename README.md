# SMART-PARKING-SYSTEM-USING-IOT
An IoT-based smart parking system designed to improve parking efficiency by detecting available parking slots in real-time. This project leverages Arduino UNO and ultrasonic sensors to minimize wait times and optimize resource utilization in parking areas.

Project Overview:
This system employs ultrasonic sensors integrated with an Arduino UNO to detect vehicles and determine parking slot availability. Algorithms for vehicle detection and slot monitoring guide drivers to open spots, reducing parking time and enhancing the overall efficiency of parking spaces.

Features:
Real-Time Vehicle Detection: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to identify available and occupied parking slots.
Slot Availability Updates: Provides real-time status updates, helping to reduce search time for available spaces.
Reduced Wait Time: Efficient algorithms minimize the average time spent searching for parking.
Resource Optimization: Ensures efficient use of parking slots, maximizing the use of available spaces.
Components:
Arduino UNO: Microcontroller to process sensor data and execute slot detection algorithms.
Ultrasonic Sensors: Detect vehicle presence in parking slots by measuring distance.
Power Supply and Connections: Provides power and connects sensors to the Arduino board.
Requirements:
Hardware: Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensors (one per parking slot), jumper wires, and a breadboard.
Software: Arduino IDE for programming and uploading code to the Arduino UNO.
